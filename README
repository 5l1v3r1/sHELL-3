sHELL
=====
This thing is a nightmare trap shell.
Makes you say please to run any commands

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Does not brick:
Debian Wheezy (bash)
FreeBSD (csh)

Bricks:
Ubuntu 13.04 (bash)
CentOS (bash) (I think)

The rest are untested.

lolcat version prints everything slow and colorful, bash only!

Run:
gem install lolcat
